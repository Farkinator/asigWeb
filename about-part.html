                    <h1>About Alpha Sigma Phi at RPI</h1>
                    Alpha Sigma Phi Beta Psi is located on scenic Belle Avenue next to several historical landmarks.

The chapter was founded in 1882 as the lambda Λ chapter of ΘΝΕ.

The chapter remained active as such till the year 1939, when due to financial constraints and inactivity due to the actions of its national organization, it petitioned to become a chapter of the ΑΚΠ fraternity in 1940 as its ΑΚ chapter.

In 1946, the chapter bought its house at 81(now 16) Belle Avenue shortly before becoming the ΒΨ chapter of ΑΣΦ.
